# Autozoomclass
Need to be in online class in lock-down. This one is with google sheets.

OPEN IT AS PROJECT FOLDER else you will have to change directory location everywhere
Here is a fully automatic zoom class with google sheets thus you can type id and password using your smartphone from anywhere and run zoom in you pc.
-make sure to watch video on how to access google sheets in python
- put credentialsand screenshots in same folder
-make a google sheet shown in screen shot

-pip install gspread 
pyautogui 
schedule 
subprocess


After running  the program if it says "Scedules started" its working fine
